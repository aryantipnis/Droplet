CS320 Droplet Project

Objectives: 
* Identify all water bottle stations on campus

* Users can track how much water they intake

How does our app work?
* Home Page : Marks each building on campus, list of Water filters and an option to navigate when clicked
* Track Page : Allows you to track your water consumption
* Account Page : Allows you to make changes to your account

* SQL Database Implementation with Supabase stored in the cloud. 
* Able to store data and access it through an API call.
* Transitioned all data from CSV files to SQL database. 
* Tracking how many times each building is queried.
